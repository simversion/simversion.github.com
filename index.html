<h3>What is it?</h3>

<p>In a sense, this is a subset of <a href="http://semver.org/">SemVer</a>, but with slightly different semantics.</p>

<h2><a name="series" aria-hidden="true"></a>Series</h2>

<p>An API has two series of releases: feature-complete, and feature-incomplete.</p>

<h3><a name="feature-incomplete" aria-hidden="true"></a>Feature-incomplete</h3>

<p>Feature-incomplete releases use a version numbering scheme <code>0.MAJOR.UPDATE</code>, where:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>0</code> indicates a feature-incomplete release</li>
<li><code>MAJOR</code> increases for releases with <em>breaking</em> changes</li>
<li><code>UPDATE</code> increases for releases with <em>compatible</em> changes</li>
</ul>

<p>Increase of the <code>MAJOR</code> version number indicates backwards-incompatible API changes.</p>

<p>Increase of the <code>UPDATE</code> number indicates any other minor change, e.g. bugfixes, new compatible features, documentation updates, etc.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>0.1.0</code> is the initial, incomplete release</li>
<li><code>0.1.1</code> is the next compatible, still-incomplete release</li>
<li><code>0.2.0</code> is the next incompatible, still-incomplete release</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that, because the <code>0.x</code> series is by definition feature-incomplete, the addition of new features is expected, and
therefore is not indicated any differently from any other change.</p>

<h3><a name="feature-complete" aria-hidden="true"></a>Feature-complete</h3>

<p>The first feature-complete release is indicated by the release of version <code>1.0.0</code>.</p>

<p>Feature-complete releases use a version numbering scheme <code>MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH</code>, where:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>MAJOR</code> increases for releases with <em>breaking</em> changes</li>
<li><code>MINOR</code> increases for releases introducing <em>new features</em></li>
<li><code>PATCH</code> increases for releases with <em>compatible</em> changes</li>
</ul>

<p>Increase of the <code>MAJOR</code> version number indicates backwards-incompatible API changes.</p>

<p>Increase of the <code>MINOR</code> version number indicates compatible API changes introducing <em>new features</em>.</p>

<p>Increase of the <code>PATCH</code> number indicates any other minor change, e.g. bugfixes, documentation updates, etc.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>1.0.0</code> is the first feature-complete release</li>
<li><code>1.0.1</code> is the next compatible release with minor changes or bugfixes</li>
<li><code>1.1.0</code> is the next compatible release introducing new features</li>
<li><code>2.0.0</code> is the next incompatible release with breaking changes</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="guide" aria-hidden="true"></a>Guidelines</h2>

<p>Every release, whether or not it's feature-complete, is considered "stable", in the sense
that it's expected to work - in terms of source-control, an unstable release should <em>never</em>
be tagged, but may exist on a pre-release branch, until it's ready for release.</p>

<p>The <code>0.x</code> release series indicates that the API is still incomplete and doesn't yet include
or support all of the planned features. Increase the version number to <code>1.0.0</code> when the API
is feature-complete.</p>

<p><em>Always</em> increase the <code>MAJOR</code> version number for any breaking change, regardless of whether the
release is feature-complete or not.</p>

<p><em>Never</em> increase the <code>MAJOR</code> version number for backwards-compatible changes.</p>

<p>The initial <code>1.0.0</code> release <em>may</em> have breaking changes - your change log should indicate if it does.</p>

<p>Deprecation is a minor change. Removal is a breaking change.</p>

<p>Accidental release of a breaking change with a minor version number increase must be corrected
by an immediate minor release reverting the change, and a subsequent <code>MAJOR</code> release.</p>

<p>A major update to an external dependency imported by your package does not automatically lead
to a major version increase in your package - while it could lead to blockage (in a package
with a conflicting version constraint for the same external dependency) it doesn't always,
for example, if changes to an external dependency do <em>not</em> result in any breaking changes to
your public API.</p>

<p>Breaking changes to <em>internal</em> APIs with a minor version increase are permitted, for classes
(and other source elements) that have been <em>explicitly</em> marked as implementation details intended
for internal use only, e.g. with a formal annotation or doc-block.</p>

<h2><a name="semver" aria-hidden="true"></a>Differences from SemVer</h2>

<p>This convention uses two distinct release series with slightly different semantics and scope,
which match the caret operator for version constraints, e.g. as implemented by package management
tools such as <a href="https://getcomposer.org/">Composer</a> and <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/">npm</a>.</p>

<p>Unlike SemVer, the feature-incomplete <code>0.x</code> series does <em>not</em> allow breaking changes from <code>0.1.0</code>
to <code>0.1.1</code> - in practice, this is generally how the caret <code>^</code> operator version constraint works
with most package managers, e.g. in <code>composer.json</code> with Composer and <code>package.json</code> with npm.</p>

<p>This convention does not permit the use of pre-release identifiers, as in <code>1.0.0-alpha</code>, etc. -
the notion of pre-releases is outside the scope of this convention, which recognizes that this
problem can solved in a number of ways, for example (typically) by treating e.g. a <code>1.0.0</code> <em>branch</em>
(under source-control) as a pre-release, and a <code>1.0.0</code> <em>tag</em> as a release.</p>
